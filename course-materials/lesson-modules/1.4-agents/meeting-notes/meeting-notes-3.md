CUSTOMER DISCOVERY CALL - ENTERPRISE PROSPECT
Date: October 3, 2024
Attendees: Sales rep (Jessica), You (Senior PM), Customer: Rachel Thomas (VP Ops at TechFlow, 600 employees)

BACKGROUND:
TechFlow is evaluating project management tools. Currently using Asana but frustrated with cost ($18k/year) and complexity. Team of 600 employees, mostly remote. Looking to switch by Q1 2025.

KEY INSIGHTS:
Rachel emphasized security requirements: SOC 2 compliance, SAML SSO, audit logs are non-negotiable. Asked about our enterprise features - impressed that we're building them now.

Pain points with Asana: too expensive, too complex, poor mobile experience, slow performance. Team complains about notification overload. Loves our async-first philosophy.

Budget: $10-12k/year (significantly less than current spend). Decision committee includes CTO, CFO, and Rachel. Timeline: decision by November, implementation in December.

CONCERNS:
Worried we're too early-stage (only 50 employees). Asked about uptime SLA, customer support response times, and data export capabilities. We addressed most concerns, but SLA question requires follow-up.

ACTION ITEMS:
- You to send enterprise features roadmap by Oct 5
- Jessica to provide case study from similar-sized customer
- You to confirm uptime SLA guarantees with engineering
- Jessica to schedule demo with their CTO next week

OPPORTUNITY: High-value deal ($12k/year). Good reference customer for enterprise segment.
