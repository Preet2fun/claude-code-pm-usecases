Mobile web experience too slow for professional use:
- Marcus (Sales Ops): "Slow and clunky... wait until back at hotel"
- Sarah (Marketing): "Functional but clunky"

### Mobile Use Cases by Urgency

**HIGH URGENCY - Field Teams & Traveling Professionals**
- Marcus (Sales): Traveling constantly - needs deal status, notes, reassignment
- James (CS): Between meetings/conferences - customer status checks
- Rachel (Enterprise): Field teams would adopt TaskFlow if mobile were better

**Frequency:** Daily, multiple times per day
**Business impact:** Delayed customer responses, missed SLAs, slower deal velocity

- Maya (Designer): Review designs during commute
- Priya (Junior PM): Check tasks between meetings
- James (CS): Status checks at conferences

**Frequency:** Daily commutes, 3-5x per day between meetings
**Business impact:** Feedback delays, forgotten action items

**MEDIUM URGENCY - Quick Status Checks**
- Multiple personas check task status 5-10x per day
- Current mobile experience "functional but clunky"
- Time wasted scrolling/navigating
