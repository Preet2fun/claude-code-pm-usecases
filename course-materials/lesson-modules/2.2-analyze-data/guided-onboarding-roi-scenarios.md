# Guided Onboarding - ROI Scenarios

**Feature:** Guided Onboarding with Sample Project
**Date:** November 26, 2025
**Analysis Type:** Three-Scenario Impact Model

---

## Why Three Scenarios?

Single-point estimates create false confidence. The realistic scenario assumes everything goes as planned, but product launches rarely do. By modeling pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios, we:

1. **Show the range of possible outcomes** - Leadership can see best/worst case
2. **Make assumptions explicit** - Forces us to think through what could go wrong (or right)
3. **Enable better decision-making** - "Even if we're wrong by 50%, is this still worth it?"

## Scenario Assumptions

| Parameter | Pessimistic (20th %ile) | Realistic (50th %ile) | Optimistic (80th %ile) |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Adoption rate** | 30% | 70% | 90% |
| **Activation lift** | 45% → 50% (+5pp) | 45% → 58% (+13pp) | 45% → 62% (+17pp) |
| **Users affected/month** | 1,500 | 3,500 | 4,500 |
| **Incremental activations** | +75/month | +455/month | +765/month |
| **Retention multiplier** | Not modeled | Not modeled | 1.3x (users stay longer) |

---

## Pessimistic Scenario (Things Go Poorly)

### Assumptions:
- **30% adoption** - Many users skip or dismiss the guided onboarding
- **45% → 50% activation** - Smaller lift than expected (only recover 10% of drop-off)
- **Low engagement** - Sample tasks don't resonate with users

### Impact:
- **Users affected:** 1,500/month (5,000 signups × 30% adoption)
- **Current activated:** 675/month (1,500 × 45%)
- **Projected activated:** 750/month (1,500 × 50%)
- **Incremental:** +75 activated users/month

### Revenue:
- **MRR impact:** 75 × $12 × 60% = $540/month
- **ARR impact:** $6,480/year
- **3-year LTV:** 75 × 12 months × $172.80 = $155,520

### ROI:
- **Year 1:** $6,480 / $100,000 = **0.06x** (6% return - not profitable)
- **3-year LTV:** $155,520 / $100,000 = **1.6x ROI**
- **Payback period:** ~15 years (never really pays back)

### What this means:
Even in a pessimistic case, we don't lose money - we just don't get much return. The feature still helps some users, but the business case is weak.

## Realistic Scenario (Expected Case)

### Assumptions:
- **70% adoption** - Most users see the guided onboarding but some skip it
- **45% → 58% activation** - Conservative recovery of 30% of drop-off
- **Moderate engagement** - Sample tasks help users understand the product

### Impact:
- **Users affected:** 3,500/month (5,000 signups × 70% adoption)
- **Current activated:** 1,575/month (3,500 × 45%)
- **Projected activated:** 2,030/month (3,500 × 58%)
- **Incremental:** +455 activated users/month

### Revenue:
- **MRR impact:** 455 × $12 × 60% = $3,276/month
- **ARR impact:** $39,312/year
- **3-year LTV:** 455 × 12 months × $172.80 = $943,488

### ROI:
- **Year 1:** $39,312 / $100,000 = **0.39x** (39% return - not yet profitable)
- **3-year LTV:** $943,488 / $100,000 = **9.4x ROI** ✅
- **Payback period:** ~30 months

### What this means:
Strong return over 3 years. Not profitable in Year 1, but well worth the investment if we're patient. This is the "most likely" scenario based on our data and assumptions.

## Optimistic Scenario (Things Go Great)

### Assumptions:
- **90% adoption** - Almost all users engage with guided onboarding
- **45% → 62% activation** - Strong lift (recover 40% of drop-off)
- **Retention boost** - Activated users stay 30% longer (1.3x multiplier on LTV)

### Impact:
- **Users affected:** 4,500/month (5,000 signups × 90% adoption)
- **Current activated:** 2,025/month (4,500 × 45%)
- **Projected activated:** 2,790/month (4,500 × 62%)
- **Incremental:** +765 activated users/month

### Revenue (without retention boost):
- **MRR impact:** 765 × $12 × 60% = $5,508/month
- **ARR impact:** $66,096/year
- **3-year LTV:** 765 × 12 months × $172.80 = $1,586,304

### Revenue (with 1.3x retention multiplier):
- **3-year LTV:** $1,586,304 × 1.3 = **$2,062,195**

### ROI:
- **Year 1:** $66,096 / $100,000 = **0.66x** (66% return - close to breakeven)
- **3-year LTV (base):** $1,586,304 / $100,000 = **15.9x ROI** 🚀
- **3-year LTV (with retention):** $2,062,195 / $100,000 = **20.6x ROI** 🚀🚀
- **Payback period:** ~18 months

### What this means:
Huge win if execution is strong. The feature becomes a growth driver, not just an incremental improvement. Retention benefits amplify the impact significantly.

## Scenario Comparison Summary

| Scenario | Adoption | Lift | Incremental Users/mo | ARR Impact | 3-Year ROI |
|----------|----------|------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| **Pessimistic** | 30% | +5pp | +75 | $6,480 | 1.6x |
| **Realistic** | 70% | +13pp | +455 | $39,312 | 9.4x ✅ |
| **Optimistic** | 90% | +17pp | +765 | $66,096 | 15.9x 🚀 |

## Key Insights

### Even the Pessimistic Case is Positive
- We get 1.6x ROI over 3 years even if adoption is low and lift is minimal
- This means the downside risk is limited - we don't lose money

### Realistic Case Has Strong ROI
- 9.4x return over 3 years for a $100k investment
- Comparable to other high-performing growth initiatives

### Optimistic Case is a Game-Changer
- 15.9x ROI (20.6x with retention boost)
- Could meaningfully accelerate company growth trajectory

### The Range is Wide But Favorable
- 1.6x to 15.9x ROI depending on execution
- All scenarios are positive, just varying degrees of success

## Additional Strategic Context

### What We're NOT Modeling:

1. **Retention improvements** - Activated users stay 2.5x longer historically. This could add 50-150% to the LTV calculations.

2. **Viral growth** - Activated users invite teammates 3x more often. Each invite → 40% acceptance → 60% activation → $172.80 LTV.

3. **Support cost reduction** - Better onboarding = fewer support tickets. Estimated 15% reduction in onboarding-related support costs.

4. **Strategic unlock** - Can't scale beyond current growth rate if activation stays at 45%. This feature enables future growth investments.

5. **Competitive necessity** - Competitors (Asana, Linear) have strong onboarding. Not shipping this risks churn to competitors.

### Why These Matter:
If we modeled retention and viral effects, the realistic scenario would be closer to **15-20x ROI**, not 9.4x. We're being conservative.

## Recommendation

**Ship it with confidence.**

Even in the pessimistic case (30% adoption, minimal lift), we get 1.6x ROI. The realistic case shows 9.4x ROI. The optimistic case is 15.9x ROI.

**Risk assessment:**
- **Downside:** Limited (positive ROI even if things go poorly)
- **Upside:** Significant (could be a major growth driver)
- **Strategic necessity:** High (must fix activation to scale)

**Decision criteria:**
- ✅ Positive ROI in all scenarios
- ✅ Strong ROI in realistic case (9.4x)
- ✅ Limited downside risk (1.6x worst case)
- ✅ Strategic importance (unblocks growth)
- ✅ Relatively small investment ($100k for a growth-stage company)

**Next steps:**
1. Get engineering validation on timeline (10 weeks realistic?)
2. Design sample project content (what tasks should we include?)
3. Plan A/B test (control vs. treatment, metrics to track)
4. Get leadership sign-off on $100k investment
